This is the start of a small series after I subscribed to the [Blogging For Devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) newsletter. I don't know where it will take me, so let's not think too much and just let it flow.

!["Don't think, just do" from Top Gun](https://media1.tenor.com/m/2-yfUiEOgQ8AAAAC/top-gun-pete-mitchell.gif)

So here's the first (or the 0th, who knows?) post of the series!

## Why Did I Sign Up?

I've always wanted to try out blogging, but I always gave up before making any meaningful progress. Either the environment setup was too difficult, or I just didn't know how to keep up with this habit. Therefore, as another attempt, I'm taking some strategies from this newsletter towards continuous blogging.

## What's Your Motivation for Blogging?

- I've seen a lot of posts about why developers should write a blog, including
	- A [brag doc](https://hackmd.io/blog/2024/06/24/brag-documents) for self-promotion and potential career growth.
	- Document what they've learned/done to share information while also gain deeper understanding by explaining something[^1].
- I've always been fond of the idea of second brain and note-taking tools like Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, Heptabase, etc. I felt like my brain memory is decaying as I'm aging. Documenting what I've learned & done is becoming a must, or else I'd forget.
- Last but not least, I want to have something to showcase when looking for a new job, and blogging seems like a good option.

## What Do You Want to Learn?

1. I want to learn how to consistently write blogs, i.e., make blogging as my habit.
2. I want to learn how to write good blog posts by understanding:
    1. What is a good blog post?
    2. How should I structure my posts?
    3. Who are my target audiences?

## Closing Up

I'm writing this down to try to figure out my intrinsic motivation for blogging. Maybe I'll come back someday to see if I've found the answers üòÅ.
