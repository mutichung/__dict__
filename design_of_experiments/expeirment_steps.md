## Seven Steps of an Experiment

1. Recognition & statement of problem.
    - All members should agree on.
1. Choice of factors, levels, and ranges.
    - Teamwork!
        - Experts tend to design experiments that are too narrow in order to prove their preconceived answer to the problem.
        - Don't let that happen! Bring in other points of view.
    - Choosing the factors
    - Levels: fairly low numbers.
    - Ranges: be **aggressive** enough to see the actual impact instead of noises.
1. Selection of the response variables.
    - What's the metric?
    - How to get those metrics? Well-calibrated instruments?
1. Choice of design.
1. Conducting the experiment.
    - Do it yourself!
    - Be there! Make sure the experiments are done correctly.
1. Statistical analysis.
    - Easy as long as steps 1 through 5 are done correctly.
1. Drawing conclusions, recommendations.
    - Data visualization matters.

## Takeaways

- Get **statistical thinking** involved early.
- Non-statistical knowledge is crucial to success.
- Pre-experimental planning (1-3) is vital.
> If you have ten weeks to solve a problem, you should spend eight weeks planning the experiment, one week executing the experiment, and one week analyzing the data.
- Think and experiment sequentially (KISS principle).
